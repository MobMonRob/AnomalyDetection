# Setup
### Using Anaconda
Import the `environment.yml` file as a new environment in Anaconda.

To use this Python environment with the Netbeans IDE, add a new Python platform by navigating to the folder of the environment and select the python.exe file. All needed paths are than set auto-magically. Be careful: The project setting can point to an other python environment. Maybe you have to change the project settings to use new configured python environment.

### Using PIP
Install Python 3.5 and PIP in the 64bit version

Run
```
pip install
```

# Run
```
python 1dim_anomalydetection.py
```
